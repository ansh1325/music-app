## üìù How It Works

### The HTML Structure
The HTML is organized into two main sections: `left` and `right`. The **left** side contains the navigation‚Äîyour library, home, and search options. The **right** side is the main content area, showcasing the playlists and the music player controls at the bottom.

### The CSS Styling
The CSS file (`style.css`) handles all the visual aspects. I used a combination of **Flexbox** for layout management and responsive design. Key styling includes:
* A dark theme for a modern look.
* Custom styling for the play buttons and cards.
* Hover effects to make the interface more interactive.
* Media queries to ensure the app is fully responsive on smaller screens.

### The JavaScript Logic
The `script.js` file is the brain of the application.
* **`getsongs()` function:** This asynchronous function fetches the songs from a specified folder on the server.
* **`playmusic()` function:** This function takes a song track as input, sets it as the audio source, and starts playing it. It also updates the song title and changes the play/pause icon.
* **Event Listeners:** I've added event listeners to handle user interactions like:
    * Clicking the play, previous, and next buttons.
    * Clicking on a song in the library to play it.
    * Clicking a playlist card to switch to a new playlist.
    * Clicking the seek bar to change the current time of the song.
    * Adjusting the volume.
    * Opening and closing the sidebar on mobile devices.

The **`currentsongindex`** variable plays a crucial role in tracking which song is currently playing, allowing the previous and next buttons to work correctly. The `audio.addEventListener('timeupdate', ...)` is particularly important as it continuously updates the position of the seek bar and the current time display as the song plays.
